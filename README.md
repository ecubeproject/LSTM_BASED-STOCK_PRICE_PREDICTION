# LSTM-Based Stock Price Predictor

Welcome to the **LSTM Stock Price Predictor** hosted on [Hugging Face Spaces](https://huggingface.co/spaces/minusquare/lstm-stock-price-predictor).  
This interactive Streamlit app predicts future stock prices using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network trained on historical time series data.

## Key Features

- LSTM-based time series forecasting  
- Interactive Streamlit UI with slider-controlled hyperparameters  
- Reproducible training with adjustable epochs, window size, batch size, dropout, etc.  
- Live visualization of training & validation loss  
- Real-time prediction vs actual price plotting  
- Automatically loads pretrained model for demo on app launch
